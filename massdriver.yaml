      title: Skip Final Snapshot
      description: Determines whether a final DB snapshot is created before the DB cluster is deleted. If true is specified, no DB snapshot is created.

          title: Auto Pause
          description: Whether to enable automatic pause. A DB cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connections).

        max_capacity:
          title: Max Capacity
          description: Each capacity unit is equivalent to a specific compute and memory configuration. Based on the maximum capacity unit setting, Aurora Serverless automatically creates scaling rules for thresholds for CPU utilization, connections, and available memory. Aurora Serverless provides more capacity for the DB cluster from warm pool of resources when its workload is above these thresholds. Aurora Serverless can increase capacity to the maximum capacity unit.
          type: number
          default: 4
          enum: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 192, 384]
        min_capacity:
          title: Min Capacity
          description: Each capacity unit is equivalent to a specific compute and memory configuration. Based on the minimum capacity unit setting, Aurora Serverless automatically creates scaling rules for thresholds for CPU utilization, connections, and available memory. Aurora Serverless reduces the resources for the DB cluster when its workload is below these thresholds. Aurora Serverless can reduce capacity down to the minimum capacity unit.
          type: number
